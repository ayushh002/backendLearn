> Here in the src folder we have made another database file which imports the userSchema from users.js present inside Models folder and then implemented all the CRUD Operations and then rather than calling it from there we have exported it which can be imported in our index.js (express) file and it should be called from there so that the database should be connected before our backend server starts.
