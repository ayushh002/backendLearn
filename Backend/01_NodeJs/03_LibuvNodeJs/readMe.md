> JavaScript (V8 Engine) itself doesn’t have built-in knowledge of timers, file system access, or network operations. These functionalities are provided by the environment in which JavaScript runs:
  : In the browser, these are handled by Web APIs (like setTimeout, fetch, DOM events, etc.), which are exposed by the browser engine.
  : In Node.js, such operations are handled by libuv, a support library primarily written in C that interfaces with the operating system for tasks like file I/O, networking, and timers.

> Libuv is an open-source, cross-platform(Windows, Linux, or Mac) support library primarily written in C. It provides an asynchronous I/O model and communicates with the operating system to perform tasks such as file system operations, networking, and timers for the backend (like in Node.js).

> The operating system performs low-level operations like timers and file I/O. Libuv acts as a bridge — it requests the OS to carry out these tasks and then waits for a signal or event to notify when the task is complete.
  : The OS indeed handles the actual execution of I/O operations.
  : Libuv doesn’t implement these operations itself — it uses system APIs to ask the OS to do the work.
  : Libuv handles waiting, event notification, and callback execution once the OS completes the task.

> For Example: 
  : setTimeout() is a JavaScript function provided by the Node.js standard library.
  : Internally, Node.js uses libuv to handle the timer mechanism, not the function definition itself.
  : Libuv requests the OS to start a timer, and when it's complete, the OS signals back to libuv, which then schedules the callback to be executed via the event loop.
